      "title": "Stream and air temperature data from stream gages and stream confluences in the Andrews Experimental Forest, 1950 to present",
      "abstract": "Stream and air temperature are measured in tandem at stream gauging stations and other selected locations and stream confluences within the Andrews Forest. Air temperature is generally measured over the stream or alongside. Currently, mean, max and min water and air temperature data are collected every 5 minutes at the gauging stations and instantaneous temperatures every 15 minutes at all other sites. Most measurements were collected hourly commencing in the later 1990s, but a few sites have daily data beginning in the late 1970s. Historic data collected 1949 to 1981 at Lookout Creek stream gauge are included with the daily summary data.\n\n      Other Andrews Forest related databases: Long term air temperature data from the reference and benchmark climate stations are also available in MS001. Previous high resolution stream temperature data at some of the small watershed stream gages are available in HT001 and stream temperature data throughout the Andrews Forest stream networks during several years are available in HT002.",
      "methods": "Field Methods - HT004: General\n          Originally, thermographs (later replaced with data loggers and thermistors) were installed at each stream site to continuously monitor stream  temperature with an adjacent  air temperature site near the stream.  Stream temperature probes are generally anchored near the stream bottom.  Air temperature was generally measured at 1 meter above the forest floor and insulated originally with an A-frame shield (later replaced with pvc-constructed shields).  Many of the probes were repositioned in the early 1990's at 1 meter above average winter snow level. Generally, sites are visited and charts / CR10 records collected on a monthly basis.  In 1987, Campbell Scientific CR-10 data loggers replaced 8 circular chart installations at the original sites.  Early Lookout Creek stream temperature data 1950-1981 was collected by the USGS.\n          The original thermograph instrument was the Dual Recording Thermometer Model RFHTT. This instrument records temperatures from two separate locations (air and soil) simultaneously on a single chart. Each of the two thermometer mechanisms operate with a mercury-filled sensing bulb which expands or contracts in response to temperature changes and in turn moves the recording pen along the calibrated chart. To prevent interference between the two pens, the right-hand pen records 1/12 revolution behind the left-hand pen. The recorder uses 10 inch 30- and 31-day Partlow circular charts that have  ranges from -30°F - 170°F or 20°F - 120°F. \n          \nThese original thermograph charts were replaced with Campbell Scientific data loggers ( typically CR10, CR21X, CR500, or CR23X) beginning in 1987.  The temperature probes used with the data loggers were type T thermocouple soldered from thermocouple wire.  These thermocouple wires have gradually been replaced through the late 1990-s with Campbell Scientific model 107 temperature probes (CS107B or CS107B-L) which include the Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor. \n        \n        The original thermograph instrument was the Dual Recording Thermometer Model RFHTT, which recorded on Partlow circular charts. Campbell Scientific data loggers with type T thermocouple soldered from thermocouple wire to measure temperature were used beginning 1987. Beginning in the late 990s Campbell Scientific model 107 temperature probes (CS107B or CS107B-L) which include the Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor were gradually installed.\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - HT004: Stream and air temperature\n          A description of sites and measurement history is here:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ht04/datalist.htm\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Laboratory Methods - HT004\n          Digitizing chart records was the primary method of capturing data until 1987 when data loggers begin to be installed.  Digitizing continued for some sites until 1995.  Charts were digitized and the record summarized by daytime, nighttime, and 24-hr period. The 24-hr mean values before 1987 are sunrise to sunrise; after January 1987 the 24-hr values are midnight to midnight. All daytime/nighttime calculation ended in 1998, and this data is only available by request.\n        \n        Digitizer is the Summagraphics/Houston Instruments model MM 1812. (Comparable product is now http://www.calcomp.com/productsummagrid6.htm)\n      \n      \n        \n          Quality Assurance - HT004\n          Quality assurance procedures included 1) missing flag check to ensure that all missing data really has the appropriate flag; 2) date/time check to verify that a record exists for each date (and hour if applicable) and that records fall in the correct order; 3) relative mean/max/min check for each record to make sure that min less than or equal to mean and mean less than or equal to max; 4) similar sites were paired and the values compared to catch any gross outliers.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Air and water temperatures are measured at gauged watersheds within the Andrews Forest and at  other stream sites including Mack and McRae Creek confluences with Lookout Creek. Stream sites nearby the Andrews were collected briefly but were discontinued. Data collection began in 1976 but several sites were discontinued by the mid-1990s. Most of the gauged watershed collections were started between 1995 and 1998.\n            Sampling frequency: Continually\n          \n        \n        \n          Stream and air temperature sites were originally selected in the upper elevations of the three major stream segments, upper Lookout, upper Mack and upper McRae Creek, that combine to form Lookout Creek, as well as off-Andrews sites in Grasshopper and Quartz Creeks.  These stream temperature sites were initiated in the late 1970's as an extension to the air and soil temperature network.  The upper Mack Creek, Quartz and Grasshopper Creek sites have been discontinued. Additional sites were added in 1995 to the confluences of Lookout-Mack and Lookout-McRae Creeks to examine mixing of water temperature compared to relative flows.  However, due to problems with maintaining sensors during winter and flood flows, the Lookout-McRae site was discontinued. In 1997, stream and air temperature sensors were placed at all Andrews gaging stations (WS#9 was not instrumented due to threat of potential vandalism).  A legacy stream temperature data set, maintained by USGS, exists from 1950 to 1981 (missing 1955-1963) at Lookout Creek gaging station.\n        \n        \n          \n            Andrews Watershed

      "abstract": "Vertical air temperature from 11 trees in the Andrews Forest has been collecting beginning in 2011. The trees are at a variety of elevations and are of various species and ages. The 11 trees were selected form the H.J Andrews phenology study air temperature network (MS045). This study examines air temperatures at multiple heights in each tree. The first sensor is at 1.5 m and subsequent sensors measure every 5 m up the tree. Each sensor includes a light (illumination) sensor, which can be used to assess the value of the data. This is not a measurement of the actual light conditions.",
      "methods": "Field Methods - MV008\n          Each of the 11 trees selected were rigged to set up temperature and light sensors up through the canopy. Loggers were installed using a pulley system and parachute cord so that downloading data and changing batteries is easily accomplished. Half of a 3-inch diameter schedule 40 PVC pipe, cut to 6-in in length for a sun shield was used at each HOBO sensor. All temperature loggers  were oriented to face south using a compass (and within what was physically possible based on the parachute cord). Temperature was programmed to be recorded every 20 minutes. The 1.5 meter sensor data is from data collected in MS045 study where temperature resolution is every 20 minutes at the bird sites and every 15 minutes at the vegetation sites.

Sites were located approximately 0.5 km apart along HJA roads.  Locations were fixed by their location relative to road intersections and clearcuts.  Approximately every 10 sites, we put out a control to compensate for background CO2 concentrations and CO2 adsorbed during the drying process. \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Laboratory Methods - SP005\n           Predried and weighed jars were used in this experiment. After the jars were exposed to the atmosphere, they were dried and weighed at the HJA.  The control jars were taken at approximately the same elevation and in the same vegetation type as the actual samples whenever possible. Soil and air temperatures were recorded when the jars were placed out and when they were retrieved (usually 24 hours later).  Max-min thermometers were placed at each site where the controls were run, and recorded 24-hour max and min air temperatures.  Soil cores were taken to a depth of 10 cm and dried at 100°C for 12 hours. The major vegetation at each site was also noted and a desription of those sites are also listed in the site description dataset.  The positions of the sites were estimated by tracing distances along roads using a map generated by Hazel Hammond and the discriptive logs were made in the field. \n          Soil respiration values have been corrected for background CO2 and CO2 adsorbed in the drying process using the mean of the control weight differences for each of the two transects.\n        \n      \n      \n        Experimental Design - SP005\n      \n      \n        \n          Sites along transects are established to be representative  of the Andrews Forest as a whole.

Hourly averaging changes times to PST and matches reference file format (where the hour represents the average of temperatures in the preceding hour). If original logger start dates are not in PDT, there is a line of code (currently 313) which can be turned on.\n          Settings: This may be run for a file or folder. The file or folder should be found in the same directory as the script. Input the file or folder name (e.g. INPUTFOLDER=\"Folder\") and comment out the unused line (e.g. #INPUTFILE). Input files should contain the site name as this name is retained through processing. Date limits should be specified under the '#Date limits' heading. These form the bookends in which the program will attempt to fill gaps using the available reference files. Reference files are stored together in a folder (e.g. REFERENCE_DIR = \"RS data for PC sites\") and are labeled with *reformatted* to distinguish them from reference files which have not been modified to match the required input format. All sites are added as they are run, so this should be run twice if they are not already included in the reference folder and you want them as reference files for sites run in the same batch.\nSite files will not be used if they have *cleaned*, *filled* or *flagged* in their file name to avoid using processed data. Reference files must be in the correct format and include *reformatted* in their filename or they will not be used. These labels are consistent with the output files from this script as well as the script to convert reference data downloaded from the Andrews website (convert_reference_data.py).\n          Description: This script serves to flag, prune, average (by hour), and fill air temperature data as detailed below. \n          Step 1: Flagging (Original time steps); Output file – (input file name)_flagged_00-0000.csv, where 00-0000 is the month-year of the last data point\n          Flagging identifies for each line (date/time) entry:\n\tnodata - Date/time recorded on the logger but contains no data.\n\tInterval does not equal 15 or 20 minutes – The time between samples was not as programmed\n\textreme – Any temperature exceeding 20 deg C or less than -20 deg C (outside of the sensor range)\n\tjump – If the change in temperature exceeds 5 deg C in one time interval\n\tair – A forward rolling window, flags when the variation in temperatures within the 24hr period is greater than the TVAR_MAX (specified at the opening of the code, currently 1.5 deg C and the temperatures are below TMIN (currently 0.2 deg C)\n\tair_past – Looks back and flags if a 'Snow' flag is present in the past 24 hours\n\nStep 2: Pruning (Original time step); Output file – (input file name)_cleaned_00-000.csv\n          Pruning removes lines containing extreme, air_past, air, jump and nodata.  \n\n          Step 3: Averaging (Hourly time step); Output file – (input file name)_00-0000_reformatted.csv\n          Averaging uses only values remaining after pruning. The number of values used to calculate the average is included as a new column.\nNotes: The command for saving this output file includes the path for the reference folder, if that folder is changed, it should also be changed in this section (or a new folder will be made with the files but they will not be used for filling). Averaging follows the convention used for Andrews weather stations where the hour represents the average of temperatures in the preceding hour. The output is in PST (while all previous outputs are in PDT, matching the raw input).\n          Step 4: Filling (Hourly time step); Output file – (input file name)_filled_00-000.csv\n          The script uses cleaned data and compares remaining entries to reference files (see Settings). This is done as a linear regression of the cleaned data with each reference file, the output includes the R2 which can be found in the text file corresponding to the input file name. Prior to filling, the script creates placeholder hours bounded by the date range specified under “Date limits” which is the range in which filling is attempted. These values are set at 1000 degrees. The script aims to fill missing (1000 degree) data by moving sequentially through the reference data in order of fit (R2). The linear regression equation is used to modify the reference value for that data point and it replaces the 1000 degree placeholder. The reference file used in the temperature value filling is listed in a neighboring column. If all reference files are examined and no data is found to replace the missing value placeholder, the placeholder is retained, thus 1000 degrees should be treated as \"no data\".\n          Step 5: Max, min, mean (Daily time step); Output file – (input file name)_daily_00-0000.csv\n          The script ignores 1000 degree data and calculates daily max, min and mean temperature values from the filled dataset.  The number of records (hours) used in the calculation is listed in the column 'count.'\n          Figures: Data points over time with flagged (and cleaned) data shown in red.

Stream temperature sensors were installed in these six streams and temperatures measured year round so that calculations of themal accumulation and degree days could occur. \n          At low elevation,  a gaged stream through old growth forest and a stream through a young forest were selected. At high elevation, a similar pair of gaged streams were selected.  Prior information on insect community composition and seasonal emergence (SA022) was used to select these sites. \n          Two additional sites were selected; one was a cold water stream whose hydrology and thermal regime is greatly impacted by a headwater spring. The final site was located near the cold water spring and in a stream that goes dry in the later summer. \n        \n        \n          \n            HJA Phenology Emergence Site 1 (WS01 stream)\n            \n              -122.25750000\n              -122.25750000\n              44.20700000\n              44.20700000\n              \n                457\n                457\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            HJA Phenology Emergence Site 2 (WS02 stream)\n            \n              -122.24930000\n              -122.24930000\n              44.21450000\n              44.21450000\n              \n                487\n                487\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            HJA Phenology Emergence Site 3 (WS08 stream)\n            \n              -122.17070000\n              -122.17070000\n              44.26640000\n              44.26640000\n              \n                959\n                959\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            HJA Phenology Emergence Site 4 (WS07 stream)\n            \n              -122.17560000\n              -122.17560000\n              44.26510000\n              44.26510000\n              \n                940\n                940\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            HJA Phenology Emergence Site 5 (Cold Creek)\n            \n              -122.12400000\n              -122.12400000\n              44.22950000\n              44.22950000\n              \n                1000\n                1000\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            HJA Phenology Emergence Site 6 (South Creek)\n            \n              -122.12050000\n              -122.12050000\n              44.22720000\n              44.22720000\n              \n                1000\n                1000\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            HJA Phenology Sites\n            \n              -122.26083000\n              -122.12205808\n              44.27442236\n              44.20746456\n              \n                1314\n                1314\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA)\n            \n              -122.26172200\n              -122.10084700\n              44.28196400\n              44.19770400\n              \n                1631\n                1631\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            <para>After sensors were downloaded, high resolution data were put through a series of programs for quality control and for filling missing values before generating the hourly averages.

      "title": "Meteorological data from the Discovery Tree at the Andrews Experimental Forest, 2015 to present",
      "abstract": "The upper-canopy of forests is known to experience a very different leaf wetness than the rest of the forest: it is often simultaneously brighter, hotter, windier, and drier. The upper canopy also contains most of the leaf area, and because it absorbs most of the solar radiation, it accounts for the great majority of carbon and water exchanges in most forests. Critically, this is also the zone where most climate variations and stress likely manifest. The upper canopy is also the region of the forest that is sampled by satellite imagery. Intensive canopy microclimate monitoring provides connections to satellite-based imagery at varying temporal and spatial scales in order to scale across the Andrews landscape and improves our understanding of forest function and its response to climate change. A 50 meter old growth tree, called the Discovery Tree, was instrumented with various sensors. A thermal infrared camera was installed in March 2014, which collects surface temperatures of the old-growth forest and the adjacent secondary-growth forest. Since then, the scope of information being acquired in real-time has increased to include temperature, leaf wetness, relative humidity, soil temperature, soil moisture, wind direction and speed. This suite of data serves as a glimpse into the canopy and soil processes we are unaware of when our feet are planted firmly on the ground. These measurements complement and leverage ongoing, long-term climate measurements collected in the sub-canopy and at the climate stations located across the Andrews forest, and potentially link with Lidar data on canopy structure and planned soil moisture measurements. Canopy thermal imaging and microclimate measurements have been established for ecophysiological applications such as monitoring the response of forest tree canopies to climate variations, including heat and drought stress.",

      "abstract": "A three-level hydro-climatological network for data monitoring was established in 1994.   The networks at each level are nested to form a coordinated program of data acquisition and measurement.  A future vision of linking the benchmark meteorological stations with regional weather stations to expand the future scope of studies was also considered in designing this network. The first-level in this top-down approach consists of Benchmark Meteorological Stations (BMS) and Benchmark Stream Stations.  The BMS are designed to represent the environment across the Andrews. These stations are intended to provide complete, long-term, high temporal resolution, meso-scale hydroclimatological data. The location of the BMS network is based on factors such as elevation, aspect, vegetation gradients, and accessibility.   Collected meteorological parameters are generally standardized across the BMS as well as methods and instrumentation.  Secondary Meteorological Stations also follow standardized methods and serve similar purposes but are somewhat limited in meteorological parameters collected.  The Primary Meteorological Station (PRIMET), Central Meteorological Station (CENMET), Upper Lookout Meteorological Station (UPLMET), and Vanilla Leaf Meteorological Station (VANMET) are the four Benchmark Stations, Climatic Station at Watershed 2 (CS2MET) and the Hi-15 Meteorological Station (H15MET) are Secondary Stations.",

The original 1.5 meter Primary Met Station sensor was housed in a Cotton Region Shelter. Historical methods included Rustrak strip charts with thermister where air temperature is measured by a Yellow Springs Instruments linear thermistor in a standard Cotton Region Shelter and continuously recorded on a separate 30-day Rustrak strip chart scaled from -10 degrees C to 40 degrees C.\n          Data loggers are typically Campbell Scientific (CR10, CR21X, CR500, or CR23X).  Early data loggers used in the 1980s are Interface Instrument models M-2, M-3, and M-4.\n        \n        Thermocouple wire; Campbell Scientific model 107 temperature probe (CS107B, CS107B-L) includes the Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor; Campbell Model HMP35C or the HMP45C probe containing a Vaisala capacitive relative humidity sensor and a Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor; Campbell Scientific data loggers (CR10, CR21X, CR500, or CR23X); Interface Instrument models M-2, M-3, and M-4\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Dew point temperature\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of dew point temperature measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/dew.htm\n          Dew Point is calculated from air temperature and relative humidity every sampling interval (generally every 15 seconds) and output hourly using Tetens Equation for the relation between temperature and the partial pressure of water vapor (see http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/dewpt_vpd_calculations.pdf). This is calculated for independent pairs of  air temperature and relative humidity probes at 150 and 450 cm heights for all benchmark stations (except CS2MET which only has sensors at 150 cm height).\n          Historical methods at PRIMET used a heated lithium-chloride dew point \nsensor with a thermistor that recorded continuously on a separate 30-day Rustrak strip chart throughout the 1970s. An Interface Instrument hygrometer with linear thermister was used to measure dew point indirectly with a heated Interface Instrument lithium-chloride hygrometer with a linear thermistor from 1979 until 1988. The PRIMET early dew point sensors and subsequent air temperature and relative humidity sensors used to calculate dew point were located in the 150 cm height cotton shelter until May 2000. The cotton shelter was discontinued for dew point calculation and replaced with use of the 450 cm probe on the PRIMET tower.\n        \n        Early instrumentation at PRIMET in the 1970s included  a heated lithium-chloride dew point sensor. The sensor temperature is measured with a thermistor and \nrecorded continuously on a separate 30-day Rustrak strip chart scaled \nfrom -5 degrees C to 20 degrees C with and with an accuracy and resolution of 1 degree C. The Interface Instrument M-2 or M-3 data logger was used. This sensor was often very unreliable. In the 1980s, dew point temperature is measured indirectly by a heated Interface Instrument lithium-chloride hygrometer with a linear thermistor. The accuracy is +/-0.5 degrees C with a resolution of 0.1 degrees C, and range of -14 to 29 degrees C. The Interface Instruments M-4 data logger was used. All other dew point measurements have been calculated from air temperature and relative humidity sensors.\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Precipitation\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of precipitation measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/ppt.htm\n          Precipitation records are generally evaluated every 5 minutes and data points are output to capture 5 minute resolution. In actuality, not all of the gauges are designed for accurate recording at this high temporal frequency except during periods of high intensity rain/snowfall. This is generally due to the sensitivity of the magnetostrictive tank gauge and associated tank diameter in measuring fluid level. The \"stand-alone\" gauges at UPLMET, VANMET and CENMET are designed for greater sensitivity to changes in tank depth and the 5 minute output is good during most precipitation events. The \"shelter gauges\" at those sites are not as sensitive to a change in fluid depth. The tipping bucket gauge at PRIMET reliably outputs tips on a 5 minute basis, although this record is somewhat artificial at 5 minute resolution, especially in light rain situations where the gage does not tip in every 5 minute\nsegment and 15 minute resolution is probably more realistic. Early chart data at CS2MET and the H15MET have been digitized and are generally accurate at 15 minutes resolution.\n          The longest continuous precipitation record on the Andrews is at the Climatic Station on  Watershed 2 (CS2MET): 1957-10-01 to Present. Data is collected weekly from a standard US Weather Bureau standard 8” rain gauge  and an adjacent Universal recording gauge (chart).  The weekly charts were originally hand digitized on a daily basis, and adjusted to the standard gauge total.  Subsequently, all charts have been electronically digitized, and data can be reliably output at a 15 minute resolution. This high resolution chart data has also been corrected to the standard gage total on a weekly basis. This Universal rain gauge was originally positioned at another location on the Andrews (at  FORKS) and that record can be used to extend the daily CS2MET precipitation record back to December, 1951. A ETI Instruments NOAH IV gauge was installed in 2011 and runs concurrently with the Universal gauge and the standard gauge\n          At the Hi-15 Meteorological Station (H15MET), a standard rain gauge has always been maintained along with an accompanying recording rain gauge.  Historically, the charts were hand digitized on a daily basis, and the daily record corrected to the standard gauge periodic total using a prorating technique. Beginning in 1992 a more reliable recording gauge was installed using a pressure transducer to measure fluid depth, and this record is available with no correction to the standard gauge, although the standard gauge is still operational. \n          At both the Upper Lookout (UPLMET) and Central (CENMET) Stations, two gauges are in operation: a stand-alone gauge with two concentric, encircling wind fences, and a second gauge atop the station shelter.  The orifice of the stand alone gauge is heated by a thermistatically-controlled propane heater. This heated gauge with the shielding fences has dramatically improved our precipitation catch, particularly in heavy snow conditions, and has prevented snow bridging over the gauge orifice. The shelter gauge is located on top of our station shelter and heated through ducts from the shelter's propane heating system. This gauge has also improved catch over the more traditionally heated rain gauges, but is protected only with an alter wind shield and catches less than the stand-alone.\n          At Vanilla Leaf (VANMET) the original gauge in the clearcut was installed in 1987 but the record is discontinued in 1996. This gauge suffered from its openly exposed siting in this high elevation clearcut. Heavy snow and inadequate  wind shielding were major problems. A stand-alone type gauge similar in design to those used at UPLMET and CENMET was installed in the adjacent and naturally sheltered meadow above the VANMET clearcut in 1998. This site takes advantage of the naturally-protected meadow and the wind fences are not employed here.\n        \n        Stand-alone rain gauges with Valdais-type concentric wind fencing are designed for use at remote Andrews locations in heavy snow conditions. The stand-alone gauges are constructed in two sections: 1) a heated orifice section 2) an unheated stand pipe section, and are designed to work with Campbell Scientific data loggers. The two concentric, encircling wind fences are used at CENMET and UPLMET (see design description http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/stand_alone_raingage_design.pdf).  Shelter-top rain gauges are currently in use at CENMET, UPLMET, and H15MET.  The shelter-top gauge sits on top of a shelter and is heated using ducted shelter heat from the shelter propane heater controlled by the datalogger and thermistor. Continuous precipitation is measured by recorded tank depth measurements (magnetostrictve tank gauges or pressure transducer) in association with Campbell Scientific data loggers. Stevens A-35 chart recorders were used at some sites as a precipitation record backup.  Wind Alter shields are typically employed. The Climatic Station at WS#2 (CS2MET) employs a Belfort Universal Recording Rain Gage, Cat No. 5-780 Series. 8\" diameter, 12\" capacity, and accuracy of .33%. The record is corrected to a nearby 8\" US Weather Service Standard Raingage. An ETI Instruments Noah IV gauge was installed in 2011. The Primary Met Station employs a Texas Electronics tipping bucket gauge with 8\" diameter orifice with data logger located on a 1 meter high platform with a Campbell Scientific data logger.\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Relative humidity\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of relative humidity measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/rel.htm\n          Generally, relative humidity is output hourly and is measured at heights of both 150 and 450 cm at these benchmark stations using Vaisala sensors with Campbell data loggers. Early records at CS2MET employed a hygrothermograph sensor to record daily max-min relative humidity from within a Cotton Region shelter on a recording chart from 1958 to 1998. Standard maximum and minimum thermometers on a Townsend support and a sling psychrometer were used to make weekly corrections to the hygrothermograph chart readings.\n        \n        Temperature and relative humidity are sampled by Campbell Model HMP35C or HMP45C probes containing a Vaisala capacitive relative humidity sensor and a Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor. The probes were originally housed in a locally-designed PVC radiation shield, which were later replaced with Gill radiation shields. Campbell Scientific data loggers are used.  The original 1.5 meter Primary Met Station sensor was housed in a Cotton Region Shelter.  Historical instrumentation include the the Weather Measure Hi-Q hygrothermograph (http://www.novalynx.com/225-5020.html), a precision, self-contained recording instrument that measures and records ambient temperature and relative humidity simultaneously on a double scale chart. A specially treated bundle of human hair is used to measure relative humidity over the full range of 0 to 100%.  The hair expands and contracts with increasing or decreasing amounts of water vapor in the air. The chart is installed on a self-contained brass clock which is spring-wound with accuracy of +/- 1%.  A Belfort hygrothermograph had been used previously in the late 1950s and 1960s. The Belfort Maximum Minimum Thermometer Cat No. 5-484 indicates the temperature extremes reached over a 24 hour period and is the standard for correcting chart temperature readings.\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Snow lysimeter\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of snow lysimeter measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/lys.htm\n          Precipitation and melting snow runoff are measured by a tipping bucket with tips summarized in 5 minute intervals. General installation: The lysmeter collection pan was constructed from 2 x 12s and plywood. The pan was covered with hyplon (white vinyl polymer), and a bathtub drain installed in one corner. The pan was installed on the ground surface and was leveled such that the collected water would flow to the corner with the drain. The water is then directed to a tipping bucket (TB) in the basement of the structure by pvc pipe which is buried to prevent freezing. The final deminsions of the lysimeter pan are 92\" x 93\" x 12\", so a volume of water equal to .01\" of ppt is 1.4032 L.\n        \n        The Campbell data logger records the Tipping Bucket snow lysimeter tips (.01\" of ppt/snowmelt input).  An electromagnetic counter acts as a check to recorded tips.  Sensors are connected to the data logger through a Campbell wiring panel.\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Snow moisture and depth\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of snow water equivalence (moisture) and snow depth measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/sno.htm\n          Snow water equivalence (SWE) and snow depth are measured every 5 minutes. Due to high variability in readings, particularly of snow depth, values may only be posted every hour for some data. Snow moisture is measured with a Park Mechanical pressure pillow and Druck pressure transducer. Snow depth is measured with a Campbell Scientific model SR50 sonic ranging snow depth sensor or Judd communications snow depth sensor.  The snow depth sensor takes up to 10 readings, performs error checking and outputs a reading in mm every 5 minutes.  Depth sensor measurement range is 0.5 to 10 meters.  The snow sensor is mounted on a long pipe extending from the shelter. The snow pillow readings are instantaneous at 5 minute intervals. Campbell Scientific data logger is used. Snow moisture and snow depth are merged in the output files.\n        \n        Snow moisture is measured with a Park Mechanical pressure pillow and Druck pressure trandsducer. Snow depth is measured with a Campbell Scientific model SR50 sonic ranging snow depth sensor or Judd communications snow depth sensor. Campbell Scientific data loggers are used.\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Snow course\n          Snow moisture and snow depth are measured with snow cores at 5 points across a transect (see entity 20).  This station snow course (transect) is near the station and tries to follow a single contour.  The average of these 5 points provides a check of the snow pillow and snow depth sensor.  Snow depth is also measured at each corner of the station snow pillow using a permanently set graduated stake (pvc pipe). The average depth is converted to snow water equivalence using the density calculated from the station snow course.\n        \n        Mt Rose snow core sampler\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Soil moisture\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of soil moisture measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/smo.htm\n          Soil moisture is measured with a water content reflectometer (WCR) beginning in 1998 replacing older gypsum block technology. Values are output on a daily basis at four depths (10, 20, 50, 100 cm) from the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET)\n        \n        Campbell Scientific CS615 Water Content Reflectometers\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Soil moisture potential\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of soil moisture potential measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/smp.htm\n          Gypsum blocks were used to record mean daily soil moisture potential at the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET) beginning in 1994. Water content reflectometers were added beginning in 1998 at all sites and all gypsum block measurements were terminated by May 2000. Hourly measurements were made between 1988 and 1990 at PRIMET but were discontinued and restarted in Oct 1994 on a daily basis only. At VANMET, soil moisture potential measurements were summarized by daytime and nighttime hours only from 1987 to 1994 at depths of 10, 20, 30 cm. From 1987 to 1993, mean daily soil moisture potentials were recorded in the rooting zone of 3 individual trees at VANMET.\n        \n        Campbell Scientific model 223 gypsum soil moisture blocks were used historically.  A polynomial equation relates changes in soil moisture with changes in block resistance.  The manufacturer supplied equation is calibrated from -.1 to -15 bars.  Values less than -15 bars are listed as out of range.

Most measurements begin in 1994 but measurements were made at PRIMET beginning in 1988 at 20 cm depth only. At VANMET, measurements were summarized by daytime and nighttime hours only from 1987 to 1993 at depths of 10, 20, 30 cm, and soil temperature was recorded in the rooting zone of 3 individual trees.\n        \n        Thermocouple wire: Probe is type T thermocouple soldered from thermocouple wire or, Campbell Scientific thermistor probe: Campbell Scientific model 107 temperature probe (CS107B, CS107B-L) includes the Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor.

Maximum solar radiation is based on instantaneous micromoles per second per square meter,  and the time of the maximum value is accurate to the minute. It is common for solar radiation sensors to read negative at night (-1 to -7), and negative nighttime readings are changed to 0.  The daily values average in these negative values, creating a minor error in the daily values.\n        \n        LICOR PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) quantum sensor, Campbell Scientific model LI190SB.  The output of the PAR sensor is a daily average, daily maximum and 15 minute averages, and the units are in micromoles/sec/meter<superscript>2</superscript>.\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Solar radiation\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of solar radiation measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/sol.htm\n          Total incoming solar radiation is recorded at the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET) and output every 15 minutes starting in 1994. This total incoming solar radiation data is also output every day in megaJoule per m2 along with the maximum daily rate of incoming solar radiation in watts per m2 and the time of the maximum accurate to the minute. Solar radiation measurement began in 1972 at PRIMET, but much of the incoming solar radiation data from the 1970's is estimated. Values are output on an hourly basis until 1994 at PRIMET. Data had originally been output as langleys but has been converted to more standard units.\n        \n        Kipp and Zonnen solar radiation pyranometer with thermopile type sensor, model CM-6B with Campbell Scientific data logger located on a 1 meter high platform at Primary Met and on top of shelters at other stations. An earlier model used was the CM-5 with an Instrument Interface M4 data logger. Historical method: The signal is recorded continuously from the Lintronic dome solarimeter on a 30-day Rustrak strip chart scaled from 0 to 2.0 cal/cm<superscript>2</superscript>/min with a resolution of 0.1 cal/cm<superscript>2</superscript>/min. Data loggers used were the Interface Instrument M-2 or M-3. This historical solar sensor was often unreliable.\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Watervapor pressure deficit\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of water vapor pressure deficit measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/vpd.htm\n          Vapor pressure deficit values are calculated and output hourly from air temperature and relative humidity probes that sample every 15 seconds. Values are output in millibars and are collected at 150 and 450 cm heights at each of the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET). The earliest hourly calculations were started at PRIMET in 1988 from air temperature and relative humidity sensors located in the 150 cm cotton shelter based on sampling every 15 seconds (in millibars). Please see the following for calculation details: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/dewpt_vpd_calculations.pdf\n        \n        Water vapor pressure deficit is computed from relative humidity and air temperature every 15 second sampling interval and output hourly.\n      \n      \n        \n          Field Methods - MS001: Wind speed and direction\n          Please follow this link to see a general description and history of precipitation measurements for these stations:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/meta/wnd.htm\n          Hourly mean wind speed, resultant mean wind vector magnitude and standard deviation, resultant mean daily wind vector direction, and daily wind direction vector components (Wind Rose) are output at each of the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET). The data logger samples every 15 seconds and the sensor is installed a 10m height.  It has been discovered that wind speed from this propeller-style wind anemometers are not accurate below 1 meter per second. Much of this data will be tagged as 'Questionable' or possibly removed.\n        \n        Wind speed and direction is sampled by a RM Young Model 05103 Wind Monitor mounted to the tower.  Potentiometer measures direction, anemometer measures wind speed.  Data logger is a Campbell Scientific model.  Data collected by the Wind Monitor is processed by the Campbell Wind Vector instruction #69 option #2. Historical method: Wind speed was measured with a cup-type anemometer which provides contact closure for every .322 km of air movement.  This signal is recorded by an event marker along the border of the same Rustrak strip chart used to record dewpoint. Data logger is Interface Instrument M-2 (1970's) or, Wind speed sensors (R.M. Young #6101 tachometer generators) were mounted on a tower.  Data logger is Interface Instrument M-4 (1980's).\n      \n      \n        \n          Models/Algorithms - MS001\n          Dewpoint and vapor pressure deficit equations can be found at:\n          http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/dewpt_vpd_calculations.pdf\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Temperature and rainfall in the Andrews Experimental Forest are are typical of a maritime climate with wet, relatively mild winters and dry, cool summers.  Humidity is generally high through winter months, and maximum daily relative humidity approaches 100 percent at night throughout the year. Minimum summer humidities generally hover around 30-50 percent.  Temperature extremes range from near 0 degrees F in unusually cold winters to over 100 degrees for brief periods almost every summer.  The range in mean annual temperature (1972-2002) is 7.1-10.5 degrees C at a low elevation site (PRIMET).  Precipitation varies with elevation - long-term annual average at low elevation (450 m) is 2200 mm, and at high elevation (1200m) is 2600 mm.\n            Sampling frequency: continuous\n          \n        \n        \n          \nMuch of the early climatological measurements on the Andrews Forest were associated with the investigation of the initial small watersheds experiment (Watersheds 1, 2, 3).   The Climatic Station on WS 2 was installed in 1956 to measure precipitation and a hygrothermograph was added in 1958.  The High-15 station was established to measure precipitation in 1964 in conjunction with small watersheds 6, 7, 8, and has evolved into a  secondary meteorological station.  A more general set of modeling needs led to the installation of the Primary Meteorological Station in 1972 to characterize the meso-scale environment. Originally, solar radiation, air temperature, dew point temperature, and windspeed were collected. Along with precipitation from the climatic station on WS 2, these were the primary climatic variables needed for the models predicting the rates at which materials accumulate or move through ecosystems (Waring et al., 1978). Significant improvements to the station were made in 1975, 1979, and 1988, as the station evolved from chart recorders to state-of-the-art digital data loggers (Bierlmaier and McKee, 1989).   The Vanilla Leaf Met Station was installed in 1987. The primary intent was to provide micro- meteorological data for a study of seedling survival following clearcut and shelterwood logging at high elevation. Ultimately, the shelterwood site was discontinued and the clearcut site has evolved as a primary high elevation meteorological station. \n\n          \nFour Benchmark  Meteorological Stations (BMS) and two second-level stations are included in the MS001 database. The Primary Meteorological and Vanilla Leaf Meteorological BMS are retained. Two new BMS are installed.  In 1994, the Upper Lookout Meteorological Station was established at high elevation (4200 ft, ENE aspect) on clearcut L708 in the SE Andrews.  In 1995 the Central Meteorological BMS was established at a centrally located site on clearcut L351 (3300 ft, WSW aspect) in the east-central Andrews.  A GIS analysis of elevation and aspect indicated the average elevation (3170 ft., 966 m) and average aspect (267 degrees) of the Andrews Forest, and the Central Met Station was located to represent these general averages.  Modifications are made to the Primary and Vanilla Leaf Stations to standardize measured variables, temporal resolution, methods, and instrumention across all BMS.  Sites will be cleared and required openings maintained following standards of the National Weather Service, the LTER network, and where appropriate, the NADP network. Telemetering of all BMS was completed in 1996.  Second-level stations (SLS) at the Hi-15 and WS 2 Climatic Station will continue to be maintained for measurement of precipitation, temperature, and other data to maintain continuity of historical records. These sites also follow established procedural standards.\n\n          \nThe BMS include meteorological measurement of air and soil temperature, relative humidity, calculated dew point temperature and vapor pressure deficit, wind speed and direction measurement, incoming solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil moisture, snow melt, and snow moisture and depth.\n\n          Citation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n          The Program for Hydroclimatological Measurement at the H.J.

      "title": "Long-term growth, mortality and regeneration of trees in permanent vegetation plots in the Pacific Northwest, 1910 to present",
      "abstract": "A network of more than 130 permanent vegetation plots provides long-term information on patterns and rates of forest succession in most of the major forest zones of the Pacific Northwest.  The plot network extends from the coast to the Cascades in western Oregon and Washington and east to ponderosa pine forests in the Oregon Cascades.\n\nMost of the permanent plots were established during two intervals: from 1910 to 1948, and from 1970 to 1989. The earlier plots were established by U.S. Forest Service researchers to quantify timber growth in young stands of important commercial species and to help answer other applied forestry questions. The more recent period of plot establishment began under the Coniferous Forest Biome program of the International Biological Program during the 1970s, and continued under the Long-term Ecological Research program. A broader set of objectives motivated plot establishment since 1970, especially quantification of composition, structure, and population and ecosystem dynamics of natural forests.\n\nPlots have one of three spatial arrangements: (1) contiguous rectangles subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; (2) circular plots subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; and (3) circular plots systematically located on long transects to sample an entire watershed, ridge, or reserve. Rectangular study areas are mostly 1.0 ha or 0.4 ha (1.0 ac) in size (slope-corrected). Circular plots are 0.1 ha (0.247 ac), not corrected for slope. The tree stratum is the focus of work in closed-forest study areas. All trees larger than a minimum diameter (5 cm for most areas) are permanently tagged.\n\nPlots are censused every 5 or 6 years.  Attributes measured or assessed at each census include tree diameter, tree vigor, and the condition of the crown and stem.  The same attributes are recorded for trees (ingrowth) that have exceeded the minimum diameter since the previous census.  In many plots tree locations are surveyed to provide a plot-specific x-y location.  A mortality assessment is done for trees that have died since the previous census.  The assessment characterizes rooting, stem, and crown condition, obvious signs of distress or disturbance, and the apparent predisposing and proximate causes of tree death.",
      "methods": "Field Methods - TV010\n               The stands are surveyed into 25 X 25 slope corrected subplots marked with permanent stakes.  All trees greater than the minimum size (usually 5 cm dbh) are tagged, diametered, vigor coded, and mapped.  The mapping is done using a 5 X 5 m grid formed with string as a guide.

      "title": "Air temperature at core phenology sites and additional bird monitoring sites in the Andrews Experimental Forest, 2009 to present",
      "abstract": "The H.J Andrews phenology study air temperature network includes 16 core phenology sites, 40 core bird sites and 128 auxiliary bird sites. This study examines air temperatures at multiple sites within the Andrews Experimental Forest. Air temperatures were recorded 1.5 m above ground at 184 sites distributed on an 800-m incomplete grid throughout much of the Andrews Forest. Data were collected using automated sensors starting in June of 2009 at 56 sites and in June 2011 128 additional sensors were added. These data document the complex spatial and temporal patterns of air temperature variation within the Andrews Forest, which is governed by multiple processes including inversions, regional air mixing, cold air drainage and pooling, and the effects of vegetation on temperature extremes. The data entities provided indicate various methods of data quality checking over time.",
      "methods": "Field Methods - MS045\n          At all the phenology air temperature sites, an Onset brand temperature sensor was placed at 1.5m above ground and shielded from direct sun. Shields were 8 inches long made from 3.5 inch diameter schedule 40 PVC pipe split in half lengthwise.\n        \n        At the 16 Phenology Core sites, Onset Hobo U22-001 (accuracy 0.2 C) were programmed to record instantaneous air temperatures at 15 min intervals. At the 40 Core Bird sites and the 128 Auxillary Bird sites, Onset Hobo Pendant temperature and light sensors UA002-64 (accuracy 0.5 C) recorded instantaneous data at 20min intervals.\n      \n      \n        \n          Quality Assurance - MS045\n          After sensors were downloaded, high resolution data were put through a series of programs for quality control and for filling missing values before generating the hourly averages (entities 2 and 4).  A major concern of quality control was to detect when the sensors were buried by snow because temperatures would be representative of the snowpack and not the air temperature.  When burial was detected, data were filled using the regression relationships with other sensors. Regressions were calculated using the best fit with other sensors during periods of time when the full data were available.\nNote: Spikes in data associated with direct light impacting the sensors were not evaluated as part of the QC programs.\n\nNote: For Phenology Core sites additional manual QA/QC was conducted to evaluate and correct snow flags and temperature spikes, resulting in data filling or reverting to original data, as needed. \n\nFor these entities (1-4), quality assurance and quality control was conducted on all temperature data collected. All data were averaged into hourly segments and run through a Python script to identify and flag impossible values, periods of missing data, and when sensors were buried by snow. Data were further checked via manual QAQC and values were compared to those from nearby temperature stations to identify any erroneous snow flags (i.e., data flagged as snow burial when there was no snow at that site), as well as temperature spikes, missing data, and other questionable values not identified by automated QAQC.  \n\nRaw data for entity 5 was flagged and not filled using the hja_hobo_clean Python programs. These data were checked for burial by snow, detection of extreme values and jumps, as well as the influence of high/extreme light intensity. \n\nRaw data for entity 6 was flagged and not filled using the GCE Toolbox workflow and based on the flagging algorithms in the hja_hobo_clean workflow. Like entity 5, these data were checked for burial by snow, detection of extreme values and jumps, as well as the influence of high/extreme light intensity. Rather than having multiple data columns for each flag, as in entity 5, these data use an aggregated flagging system for each data variable (temperature and light).\n      \n      \n        \n          Statistics - MS045\n          Evaluation of the high resolution temperatures (15 and 20 minute intervals) was conducted and questionable data flagged. Before calculation of hourly averages, flagged data were removed and missing values calculated using regression relationships with other temperature data from Andrews Forest for that period.\n\nScript name: WaTeR.py (used to create entities 2 and 4)\nThis script was designed to flag, clean, average by hour, and fill data from air temperature sensors deployed at the HJ Andrews.  \n\nA revised Python program was used to flag the raw data in entity 5. This program also cleans and fills, but these data are not provided. A researcher can download the Python program from Bitbucket, the  raw data from entity 5, and run the program. There is also a visualization program.\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/account/user/hjandrews/projects/PHEN\n\nDatasets:  The WaTeR.py script creates folders: flagged, cleaned, reference, and filled.  These contain:\n\nflagged original data with flags\ncleaned data with the flags removed\nreference cleaned data averaged into hourly timesteps \nfilled cleaned data which has been filled using other files in the reference folder based on their respective regressions\nsummary daily values with min, max and mean\n\nRequires: Python, SciPy and NumPy\n\nNote: This program was written for data loggers started during June (daylight savings time). Since ONSET uses the computer clock for time stamps, raw times are in PDT not PST. Hourly averaging changes times to PST and matches reference file format (where the hour represents the average of temperatures in the preceding hour). If original logger start dates are not in PDT, there is a line of code (currently 313) which can be turned on.\n\nSettings: This may be run for a file or folder. The file or folder should be found in the same directory as the script. Input the file or folder name (e.g. INPUTFOLDER=\"Folder\") and comment out the unused line (e.g. #INPUTFILE). Input files should contain the site name as this name is retained through processing. Date limits should be specified under the '#Date limits' heading. These form the bookends in which the program will attempt to fill gaps using the available reference files. Reference files are stored together in a folder (e.g. REFERENCE_DIR = \"RS data for PC sites\") and are labeled with *reformatted* to distinguish them from reference files which have not been modified to match the required input format. All sites are added as they are run, so this should be run twice if they are not already included in the reference folder and you want them as reference files for sites run in the same batch.\nSite files will not be used if they have *cleaned*, *filled* or *flagged* in their file name to avoid using processed data. Reference files must be in the correct format and include *reformatted* in their filename or they will not be used. These labels are consistent with the output files from this script as well as the script to convert reference data downloaded from the Andrews website (convert_reference_data.py). \n\nDescription: This script serves to flag, prune, average (by hour), and fill air temperature data as detailed below. This script was applied to the raw data that created entities 2 and 4\n\nStep 1: Flagging (Original time steps); Output file – (input file name)_flagged_00-0000.csv, where 00-0000 is the month-year of the last data point\nFlagging identifies for each line (date/time) entry:\n\tnodata - Date/time recorded on the logger but contains no data.\n\tInterval does not equal 15 or 20 minutes – The time between samples was not as programmed\n\textreme – Any temperature exceeding 20 deg C or less than -20 deg C (outside of the sensor range)\n\tjump – If the change in temperature exceeds 5 deg C in one time interval\n\tair – A forward rolling window, flags when the variation in temperatures within the 24hr period is greater than the TVAR_MAX (specified at the opening of the code, currently 1.5 deg C and the temperatures are below TMIN (currently 0.2 deg C)\n\tair_past – Looks back and flags if a 'Snow' flag is present in the past 24 hours\n\nStep 2: Pruning (Original time step); Output file – (input file name)_cleaned_00-000.csv\nPruning removes lines containing extreme, air_past, air, jump and nodata.  \n\nStep 3: Averaging (Hourly time step); Output file – (input file name)_00-0000_reformatted.csv\nAveraging uses only values remaining after pruning. The number of values used to calculate the average is included as a new column.\nNotes: The command for saving this output file includes the path for the reference folder, if that folder is changed, it should also be changed in this section (or a new folder will be made with the files but they will not be used for filling). Averaging follows the convention used for Andrews weather stations where the hour represents the average of temperatures in the preceding hour. The output is in PST (while all previous outputs are in PDT, matching the raw input).\n\nStep 4: Filling (Hourly time step); Output file – (input file name)_filled_00-000.csv\nThe script uses cleaned data and compares remaining entries to reference files (see Settings). This is done as a linear regression of the cleaned data with each reference file, the output includes the R2 which can be found in the text file corresponding to the input file name. Prior to filling, the script creates placeholder hours bounded by the date range specified under “Date limits” which is the range in which filling is attempted. These values are set at 1000 degrees. The script aims to fill missing (1000 degree) data by moving sequentially through the reference data in order of fit (R2). The linear regression equation is used to modify the reference value for that data point and it replaces the 1000 degree placeholder. The reference file used in the temperature value filling is listed in a neighboring column. If all reference files are examined and no data is found to replace the missing value placeholder, the placeholder is retained, thus 1000 degrees should be treated as \"no data\".\n\nStep 5: Max, min, mean (Daily time step); Output file – (input file name)_daily_00-0000.csv\nThe script ignores 1000 degree data and calculates daily max, min and mean temperature values from the filled dataset.  The number of records (hours) used in the calculation is listed in the column 'count.'\n\nFigures: Data points over time with flagged (and cleaned) data shown in red.  Located within the \"flagged\" folder as .pdfs.\n      \n      \n        \n          \n            HJ Andrews Phenology sites Sampling frequency: Continuous\n        \n        \n          Sixteen core phenology sites were selected based on locations of long term air temperature and vegetation data at reference stands. Distribution of study sites was augmented by adding a few additional sites. At these Core sites, air temperature was measured year round and plant phenology, insect and bird abundances was measured during springtime from 2009-2014.\nAdditional sensors were placed at 40 Core Bird sites and 124 Auxillary Bird sites. These locations were stratified across elevation, forest type, and distance to roads to insure that the full environmental gradient was sampled, with a minimum distance between sampling points of 300m.\n        \n          \n            HJA Phenology Auxiliary Site 002\n            \n              -122.20169127\n              -122.20169127\n              44.23091130\n

A major concern of quality control was to detect when the sensors were buried by snow because temperatures would be representative of the snowpack and not the air temperature.  When burial was detected, data were filled using the regression relationships with other sensors.

All data were averaged into hourly segments and run through a Python script to identify and flag impossible values, periods of missing data, and when sensors were buried by snow. Data were further checked via manual QAQC and values were compared to those from nearby temperature stations to identify any erroneous snow flags (i.e., data flagged as snow burial when there was no snow at that site), as well as temperature spikes, missing data, and other questionable values not identified by automated QAQC.  </para>\n\n<para>Raw data for entity 5 was flagged and not filled using the hja_hobo_clean Python programs. These data were checked for burial by snow, detection of extreme values and jumps, as well as the influence of high/extreme light intensity. </para>\n\n<para>Raw data for entity 6 was flagged and not filled using the GCE Toolbox workflow and based on the flagging algorithms in the hja_hobo_clean workflow. Like entity 5, these data were checked for burial by snow, detection of extreme values and jumps, as well as the influence of high/extreme light intensity. Rather than having multiple data columns for each flag, as in entity 5, these data use an aggregated flagging system for each data variable (temperature and light).</para>",

Andrews Experimental Forest, located in Oregon’s Western Cascades (44.21, -122.26, elevation 430m). PRIMET is sited in a relatively flat clearing approximately 29 x 23 m2 in size, with conifer forests outside the perimeter. It is located in the bottom of a valley with steep ridges to the southeast and northwest. Annual precipitation averages 2200 mm and occurs primarily November through May. Snow can accumulate at this site in winter, but it does not remain for long periods. Summers are generally dry and warm, with cool nights and occasional thunderstorms. Sampling frequency: 15 and 5 minute\n        \n        \n          Instruments measuring air temperature, wind speed, incoming solar radiation and reflected solar radiation were placed side-by-side at 1.5m above the ground. There were four air temperature instruments, all using an identical sensor (Campbell Scientific 107 thermistor) but different radiation shields: 1) fan-aspirated (ASP or aspirated), 2) cotton region shelter (CRS), 3) Gill multi-plate (Gill), and 4) a custom-fabricated shield developed by staff at the research site (HJA). One propeller anemometer was used to measure wind speed. One upward-facing pyranometer measured incoming solar radiation (ISR), and one down-facing pyranometer measured reflected solar radiation (RSR). All sensors were connected to the same Campbell Scientific CR1000 data logger.\n        \n        \n          \n            Primary Meteorological Station\n            \n              -122.25594100\n              -122.25594100\n              44.21189300\n              44.21189300\n              \n                436\n                436\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA)\n            \n              -122.26172200\n              -122.10084700\n              44.28196400\n              44.19770400\n              \n                1631\n                1631\n                meter\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            <para>Air temperature, incoming and reflected solar radiation, and wind speed data were collected continuously between July 2010 and April 2017. Measurements were taken every 15 seconds, and the average for a 15-minute period (60 observations) was recorded (referred to hereafter as “15-minute average observations”). Additionally, from April 2015 to April 2017, measurements were taken every 15 seconds, and for each 5-minute period (20 observations), the maximum and minimum air temperature and maximum incoming and reflected solar radiation and wind speed were recorded (referred to hereafter as “5-minute observations” with the relevant statistic specified). </para>\n<para>All data were reviewed for quality control using an automated process (GCE Data Toolbox Version 3.9.4b - https://gce-lter.marsci.uga.edu/public/im/tools/data_toolbox.htm). Rows with missing observations for aspirated air temperature, incoming solar radiation, reflected solar radiation, or wind speed were removed, with a total of 6,097 rows (out of 210,504) removed from the 15-minute data and 8,358 rows (out of 210,792) removed from the 5-minute data. Data logger issues from February 27-March 7, 2013 and August 2-31 in 2016 caused most missing values. </para>",
